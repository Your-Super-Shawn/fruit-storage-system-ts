# Fruit Storage System API | Test Playground

A lightweight app built using Next.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, Nexus, and MongoDB, designed primarily for testing backend API functionality of the Fruit Storage System.

## Overview

This project serves as a simple, user-friendly testing interface for the Fruit Storage System's backend API. It allows users to:

- Test Create, Update, Store, Remove and Delete (CRUD) operations for fruit entries
- Test storing and removing fruits from the inventory
- Verify each fruit's name, description, and storage limit

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Next.js    | Creating the web application with server-rendered components   |
| TypeScript | Static types to improve code quality and maintainability       |
| GraphQL    | Query language used to define the API for the application      |
| Nexus      | Library to create a GraphQL schema using a code-first approach |
| MongoDB    | NoSQL database used for storing data                           |
